# Clock
CS 210 Project One

This project was used to create a clock so the user can have the time in 12 and 24 hour format.
One thing I felt I did well was the user interface for the clock.
I could have enhanced my code with making it more simple for other developers to modify. Making the code more streamlined could help in the long term with program efficiency.
The most challenging part of the code to write was the frame around the time since the time is dynamic and could shift the borders. I overcame this by using loops to make sure the frame will always be a static object.
The skills I gained from understanding loops during this project will help in the future when I need to use loops to create static displays.
I made this program readable by almost overextending my code, making it easy for any other developer to see the step by step process that the clock uses to run.
